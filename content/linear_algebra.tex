\section{Linear Algebra}

\subsection{Plane equation}
Assume that we know point, which belongs to plane $P_0=(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ and 
we have a normal vector to the plane $\vec{n}=(a,b,c)$. Now assume that $P=(x,y,z)$
is any point in the plane. Define position vectors $\vec{r_0}$ and $\vec{r}$
from our coord. system to points $P_0$ and $P$ on the plane respectively. Vector $\vec{r_0} - \vec{r}$
lies in our plane. Then $\vec{n} \cdot (\vec{r_0} - \vec{r}) = 0$ is our plane equation.

	

\subsection{Distance}

Consider a line  $L$  in  $\mathbb{R}^2$  given by the equation $L:\theta \cdot x + \theta_0=$ where $\theta$ is a vector normal to the line $L$. Let the point $P$ be the endpoint of a vector $x_0$(so the coordinates of $P$  equal the components of $x_0$).\\

The shortest distance $d$ between the line $L$ and the point $P$ is:
\begin{align*}
d= \displaystyle \frac{\mid \theta \cdot x_0+ \theta _0\mid }{\mid \mid \theta \mid \mid }
\end{align*}
